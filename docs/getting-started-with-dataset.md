# Getting started with dataset

_dataset_ is a set of tools to manage JSON objects as a collection of key/value pairs stored on either your
local file system, AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. These documents can be interated over or retrieved individually.
There is also a full text indexer for supporting fielded or full text searches based on the index definitions.
One final feature of _dataset_ is the ability to add attachments to your JSON objects. These attachments are stored
in a simple archive format called tar. Basic metadata can be retrieved, and the attachments can be retreive as a group
or individually.

## Getting dataset onto your computer

The command line tools that form dataset are available for installation from https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/latest.

file and copy the programs into are directory in a local "bin" directory of your comptuer. For full instructions on installation see
