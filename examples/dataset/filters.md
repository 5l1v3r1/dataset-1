## Filters

Filter can be used to return only the record keys that return true for a given
expression. Here's is a simple case for match records where name is equal to
"Mojo Sam".

```shell
   dataset filter '(eq .name "Mojo Sam")'
```

If you are using a complex filter it can read a file in and apply it as a filter.

```shell
   dataset filter < myfilter.txt
```
