# Installing dataset Python module

_dataset_ is available to Python 3.6 based on a C shared library derived from the _dataset_ Go packaged. When compiling
from scratch you need Go 1.10, Python 3.6 and GNU Make.  The make file will compile the shared library (e.g. libdataset.so,
libdataset.dll, or libdataset.dylib) placing it in the *dataset* module directory.  After this is done you can then run
the standard `python3 setup.py` to install the package on to your system. 

If you are install from the Zip archive.

1. Go to https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/latest/release and find the Python module file associated with your operating system
2. Download `py3-dataset-VERSION-OS-ARCHITECTURE.zip` (where VERSION is a version number, OS refers to the opperating system and ARCHITECTURE refers to the type of CPU)
3. Unzip the zip file and change directory into that location
4. Run `sudo python3 setup.py` (sudo is optional but often needed depending on how your Python is installed) to install on your system.
